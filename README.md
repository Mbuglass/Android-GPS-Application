# Android GPS Application 
## Overview
Built as a final year project, this application is intended to collect crowd-sourced data relating to landmarks and other points of interest, allowing locals to share their knowledge of the area.
Additionally, the application would allow the marking of items not shown on more traditional maps such as the location of street art, for those looking to see a more artistic side of their city, or useful facilities such as toilets or bins - which can sometimes be difficult to locate when they are most needed.
